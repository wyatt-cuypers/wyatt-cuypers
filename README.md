# Hello! My name is Wyatt
I am a North Dakota State University alumni as of May 2023. I currently work as a Software Engineer at 701x, working mainly in React and React Native. I have extensive experience in TypeScript, JavaScript, Ruby, Java, C#, REST APIs and fullstack development.

# Experience
### 701x - Fargo, ND
#### October 2022 - Present
I began as an intern at 701x in the fall of 2022 while I was still in school. In my time as an intern, I began learning the basics of real world software development as well as being part of a collaborative team. I started full-time in June of 2023 and have since then become very proficient in React development / front-end development as a whole.
### ComDel Innovation - Wahpeton, ND
#### May 2022 - August 2022
Over the summer of 2022 I had the privilege of interning at ComDel Innovation (located in Wahpeton, ND) as part of the IT department. That being said, while I did work on some IT-oriented work, I was mostly assigned to write programs intended to work alongside manufacturing machinery in the company's warehouse. Most of these projects and their descriptions for them can be found in my page's repository list.
